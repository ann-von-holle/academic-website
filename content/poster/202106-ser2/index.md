abstract: "Serum iron levels may be important contributors to health outcomes, but it is not often feasible to measure levels in the large scale or long-term studies needed to study health risks. Predictive exposure models that use factors such as supplement use, lifestyle, and blood donation that have been associated with iron status, may provide a more feasible alternative for studying health effects associated with iron status.  **Methods:**
Using three serum iron measures (iron (mg/dL), ferritin (mg/dL), and transferrin saturation (%)) collected at study entry in the US-wide Sister Study, we estimated associations with common iron predictors at baseline with simple age-adjusted multivariable linear regression models or splines depending on fit for women who were postmenopausal at study entry (n=2,088). **Results:** Positive linear associations with log transformed serum ferritin (coefficient; 95% CI) included alcoholic drinks per month (0.004; 0.003, 0.006), meat consumption (per 16 ounces per day) (0.006; 0.004, 0.009), and body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) (0.003; -0.003, 0.009). Inverse associations included history of blood donation (-0.19; -0.26, -0.12), ever-diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia (-0.17; -0.25, -0.09), current hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use (-0.17; -0.26, -0.07), dietary and supplemental calcium (dg) (-0.012; -0.018, -0.007), and exercise (hours per month) (-0.001; -0.003, 0.002). Serum ferritin increased until around 20 months since the last menstrual period then declined. Directions of association for these predictors were similar for iron and transferrin saturation outcomes except for BMI, HRT, and exercise. The R2 indicating proportion of variance in outcome explained by the predictors was 0.08 for iron, 0.10 for ferritin and 0.08 for transferrin saturation.  **Summary:** Common predictors of iron status largely match expected directions of association, but they do not explain a large proportion of variance of serum iron indicators commonly used in clinical practice."
