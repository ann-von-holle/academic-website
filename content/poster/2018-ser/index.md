abstract: "Background: Infant growth varies across socioeconomic factors including maternal education and income, serving as an indicator of environmental influence in early life with long term health consequences. Previous research has identified sociodemographic gradients in growth with a focus on the first year and beyond, but estimates are sparse for growth before 6 months. Methods: Participants (n=l,412) were from a randomized iron deficiency anemia prevention trial in healthy infants from low- to middle-income neighborhoods in Santiago, Chile (1991-1996). Anthropometric measures included monthly weight (kg), length (cm) and weight-for-length (WFL) values from 0 to 5 months. For each measure, we estimated 3 individual-level growth parameters (size, timing and velocity) as outcomes from Superimposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) models. Subsequently, we used lasso regression with post-selection inference methods to estimate the linear association between each of the growth parameter outcomes and covariates including gestational age, maternal age, education, and socioeconomic position (SEP). We used a false discovery rate=0.05 to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: Lower SEP was associated with higher length velocity growth parameters for both males (0.21, 95% Cl=0.14,0.37), females (0.17, 95% Cl=0.05,0.31), and the pooled sample (0.22, 95% Cl=0.13,0.31) -- outcome units are percent increase in velocity above the average growth curve. Lower SEP was also associated with slower growth timing for females (0.25, 95% Cl=0.05,0.42) -- outcome units are shifts in days from the average growth curve. Conclusion: Previous research on growth in older infants and children shows positive associations between income and/or maternal education with length velocity. We found evidence supporting an opposite direction of association at an earlier age, which may inform age-specific prevention efforts aimed at infant growth."
