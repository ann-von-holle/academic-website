abstract: "Iron is both a growth factor that is essential to life and potentially toxic. Extremely high iron stores are associated with increased risk of some cancers. Epidemiologic studies of associations between iron levels and breast cancer are both sparse and inconsistent. A recent meta-analysis found positive associations between serum iron biomarkers and breast cancer, but heterogeneity among studies. Our aim was to assess breast cancer incidence in relation to three serum iron biomarkers: iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation in a prospective cohort study. We sampled participants in the Sister Study, a cohort of 50,884 women aged 35-74 who had never had breast cancer themselves but had an affected sister. The case-cohort sample of 5,982 women, including 2,995 incident cases, had been followed for a median of 7.9 years. Serum iron biomarkers were measured in baseline samples. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) for the biomarkers, which we analyzed both as categorical (quartiles) and continuous. We adjusted for baseline smoking, alcohol, education, HRT, parity, oral contraceptive use, early menopause <= 45 years), time since last menstrual period, BMI, menopause status and a product term between the last two variables. Median (IQR) serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation was 93 (74, 115) ug/dL, 68 (37, 114) ug/L, and 29% (22, 36), respectively. Adjusted HRs for the highest versus lowest quartiles (95% CI) were 1.06 (0.90, 1.24) for iron, 1.01 (0.86, 1.20) for ferritin, and 0.94 (0.79, 1.10) for transferrin saturation. A sensitivity analysis restricting to the first four years of follow-up indicated similarly near-null hazard ratios. In a study with a large sample size and with all three measures  of circulating iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation, we found no evidence to support an association between iron status and breast cancer risk."
