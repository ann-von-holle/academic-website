abstract: "For epidemiologic studies, iron measurements are often based on serum. Toenails offer a convenient alternative to serum because of ease of collection, transport, and storage. No study has examined the correlation between the serum and toenail measures for iron. Our aim was to compare measures using serum and toenails iron measures on a cross-sectional and longitudinal basis. Using a sample from the US-wide prospective Sister Study cohort, we compared trace iron levels in toenails with three serum biomarkers: iron, ferritin and percent transferrin saturation. Participants (N=281) donated both blood and toenails at baseline (2003-2009) and a subsample (59%, n=165) provided specimens again about 8 (IQR: 7,9) years later. Cross-sectional analyses included Spearman's rank correlation to assess nail/serum association and coefficient of variation comparisons. We also considered maintenance of rank across time separately for nails and for serum, and compared Spearman's correlation coefficients of repeated measures for nail and serum values. Overall, nail and serum iron values did not correlate well with each other. Spearman correlations at baseline (follow-up) were 0.09 (0.04) for serum iron, 0.11 (0.02) for transferrin saturation, and -0.08 (0.01) for ferritin. Nail measures at baseline (follow-up) had a higher coefficient of variation 1.22 (0.94) than serum iron 0.36 (0.33), ferritin 1.01 (0.93), and transferrin saturation 0.38 (0.33). The Spearman correlation for nail iron between repeats across the two time points (0.47, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.60) was higher than for serum iron (0.25, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.39), transferrin saturation (0.33, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.47), and ferritin (0.45, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.58). Based on cross-sectional and repeated assessments, iron measures based on serum did not correlate with those based on toenails. Toenail iron measures appear to be repeatable, but cannot be taken as a proxy for serum iron values and may represent different mechanisms of iron storage.  "
