abstract: "Familial clustering of age at onset would have implications for both risk prediction and etiology but has not been well-studied for breast cancer. We used a large cohort of unaffected sisters of proband cases to prospectively study whether breast cancer risk is influenced by the age at diagnosis of a previously affected sister. More than 50,000 women were followed for an average of 8 years in the Sister Study. Participants had never had breast cancer when they enrolled but had at least one sister previously diagnosed with breast cancer. With age as the primary time scale, we used Cox models to estimate the relative hazard associated with being at an age close to the age at which the sister had been diagnosed. The covariate characterizing closeness was a Gaussian function of the difference between the participant’s time-varying age at risk and her sister’s age at diagnosis, allowing for a symmetric effect that peaks when the participant reaches the proband sister’s age at diagnosis. Other covariates in the model included: age at first live birth, age at menarche, an indicator variable for proband age at onset less than 50 years, BMI, menopause status and the product of BMI and menopause status. Another model permitted the age-closeness effect to depend on the time-varying age of the sister at risk. The estimated peak adjusted hazard ratio was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.63). The adjusted model that included the age-closeness covariate had a better fit than the model excluding that covariate (Chi-square(1df) = 14.5, p<0.001). Evidence also supported age-time-dependence of the closeness association, with a larger magnitude of association at ages greater than 60 years. In summary, in the largest study of its kind for breast cancer, the risk increased at ages near the age when a sister had been diagnosed. This association suggests that there are important shared genetic and environmental contributions to age at onset.well-studied for breast cancer.
