**Abstract**

Growth in early infancy is hypothesized to affect chronic disease risk factors later in life. To date, most reports draw on European ancestry cohorts with few repeated observations in early infancy. We investigated the association between infant growth from birth to 5 months and lipid levels in adolescents in a Hispanic/Latino cohort to determine if previous findings generalize to diverse study populations and to obtain more detailed growth estimates.

**Study design**

We characterized infant growth with monthly measures from birth to five months in males (n=311) and females (n=285) from the Santiago Longitudinal Study (SLS) using three metrics: weight (kg), length (cm) and weight-for-length (g/cm). Nonlinear mixed effects (SITAR) and latent growth mixture models (LGMM) were two approaches to estimate infant growth characteristics. Growth was the exposure and lipid levels at 17 years were the outcomes, including HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, and a TG:HDL-C ratio.

**Results**

We found a positive relationship between the SITAR length velocity parameter before six months of age and HDL-C levels in adolescence (11.5, SE=4.1) indicating higher HDL-C levels occurring with faster length growth. The strongest associations from the LGMM models were between higher LDL-C and slower WFL growth. However, no associations from the LGMM models were statistically significant after accounting for multiple hypothesis testing. When assessing average lipid values across these latent class groups, most associations pointed towards the faster growth groups having more favorable lipid profiles.

**Conclusion**

This study provides evidence of associations between infant growth from birth to five months and blood lipid profiles during adolescence. In each case, slower growth is associated with adverse lipid profiles - not faster growth as originally hypothesized. Further research with larger samples in this window of time can better distinguish the role of growth in early versus later infancy and childhood as an exposure affecting cardiovascular disease risk factors in adolescence.
