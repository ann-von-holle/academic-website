I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/index.cfm) at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). My current work focuses on iron biomarkers and breast cancer incidence. For my dissertation, I studied the association between infant growth and lipid levels later in adolescence in a Chilean cohort.
