I made several [Shiny Apps](https://www.shinyapps.io/) in my first year of graduate school in the UNC Department of Epidemiology demonstrating:

#### Time dependence in survival analyses

This [app](https://vonholleunc.shinyapps.io/survival/) simulates examples of time dependence in survival analyses.

[code](https://github.com/avonholle/survival-app-shiny)

#### Statistical interaction and confouding

This [app](https://vonholleunc.shinyapps.io/int_and_conf/) simulates both statistical interaction and confounding.

[code](https://github.com/avonholle/int-and-conf)

#### Additive and multiplicative effect modification, part 1

This [app](https://vonholleunc.shinyapps.io/int_and_conf/) simulates interaction on additive versus multiplicative scale. The example is from the Hosmer and Lemeshow 2013 textbook ['Applied Logistic Regression'](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Applied+Logistic+Regression%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780470582473), section 10.9.1, pages 448 to 451, titled, "Additive versus Multiplicative Scale -- Risk difference versus odds ratio".

#### Additive and multiplicative effect modification, part 2

This [app](https://vonholleunc.shinyapps.io/add-mult-int-3/) simulates additive and multiplicative interaction based on example in the  ['Applied Logistic Regression'](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Applied+Logistic+Regression%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780470582473) textbook, section 10.9.2, pages 451-456.
